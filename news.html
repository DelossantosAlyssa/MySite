<h1> JYP Entertainment to purchase and remodel a large building for its new company headquarters </h1>
<h5> It has been reported that JYP Entertainment will be purchasing and remodeling a large building <br>
in Seoul's Olympic Park to be used as their new company headquarters. This has gained attention as to <br>
whether they will be using their treasury stock worth 20 Billion KRW $17.8 million (approx.) into this building. <br>
They have decided to leave their current building that has been used since 2002. Currently, they are using five <br>
different buildings for its operations with the main building in Cheongdam-dong but have now decided to move <br>
 to one large building that can house everything and everyone within the company under one roof. With the <br>
 location close to the Lotte Tower, Han River, and many other attractions, it seems to be a smart and calculated <br>
 move in order to expand to a wider audience across the world. <br>
